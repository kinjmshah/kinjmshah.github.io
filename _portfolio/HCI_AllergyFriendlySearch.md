title: "Human-Computer Interaction: Accessibility -- Improving Dining Out for Individuals Living with Severe Allergies"
permalink: /portfolio/HCI-Accessibility
---

Food allergies affect more than 32 million Americans each year [1]. Reactions to food allergies can range in severity, and the number of individuals with a severe food allergy is on the rise [1]. For those who have severe reactions to allergen exposure, eating out is not just a social experience, it’s a serious medical risk. “Each year in the U.S., 200,000 people require emergency medical care for allergic reactions to food” [1]. Even with growing consideration in the food industry to consider dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegan options, there is still a significant hurdle for those with severe allergies to overcome when eating in an uncontrolled environment. Our project focuses on this community of individuals who suffer from severe food allergies and aims to find a solution that lowers the barrier preventing members of this group from feeling safe in daily interactions.

### Inclusive Design
In a recent talk, Kat Holmes discusses how it is the responsibility of designers to minimize mismatches between a person’s body and the designed interface/technology [2]. The current restaurant search process creates a significant mismatch between the needs of individuals with allergies and the current available technologies. Our solution aims to use inclusive design principles; in particular, by collaborating at each iteration step with a co-designer who has a severe allergy to create a solution that addresses this mismatch.

<!-- ## User Personas
To be most effective in helping the community of people living with a severe food allergy, we first reached out to individuals in our circle who we knew had an allergy. Our participants were all allergic to some kind of nut and had medium to high severity, meaning that exposure would likely require them to administer epinephrine (EpiPen) and then seek immediate medical attention. 
### Co-designer
***Jane Doe 1***              
Allergy: Tree nuts                 
Allergy Severity: High – Definite anaphylaxis              
Allergy Sensitivity: Sensitive to ingestion                 
Current Occupation: PhD student             
Use of Restaurant/Food Search Engines: Medium, frequently wants to eat at restaurants or order take out, but sometimes effort to find safe food hinders efforts             
Goals: Order food quickly and safely             
### Other Participants*
***Jane Doe 2***           
Allergy: Tree nuts
Allergy Severity: Medium – Potential anaphylaxis
Allergy Sensitivity: Sensitive to ingestion
Current Occupation: Student 
Use of Restaurant/Food Search Engines: High, works long hours, so often orders take out 
Goals: Order food quickly and safely 
***Jane Doe 3 (Sibling of individual with severe allergy)***            
Allergy: Peanuts
Allergy Severity:  High – Definite anaphylaxis
Allergy Sensitivity: Sensitive to ingestion and touch 
Current Occupation: Data Scientist 
Use of Restaurant/Food Search Engines: High, frequently eats at restaurants or orders take out in personal life with sibling. Also handles large lunch catering orders at work due to experience with handling allergies. 
Goals: Have a system that improves awareness of allergy information
Notable Comments: Has seen individuals not take precautions against even the most common allergies such as peanuts
## User Research
### Elicitation Diary
To get more information about our problem space we performed Elicitation Diary interviews with 3 participants who all suffer from severe allergies. The questions asked to prompt the participants for information are listed below:            
1. What are difficulties when going out in public that you're concerned with (w/ a severe allergy)?
2. What is the biggest danger/concern of exposure to your allergen? 
3. How do you determine if a place is “safe” for you? What is your criteria? How to you judge a place when you are there?
4. What is the process you use to choose a place to eat? 
5. How do you select food choices or what to eat? How far removed does something have to be for you to consider it safe? (in a different area of the kitchen, cookware never used with allergen, etc.) 
6. What would make you feel more confident about a restaurant? 
7. Do you have any thoughts on how things can be improved for you? Are there things that would make your life easier/the experience of “eating out” more accessible and safe to you?
Our goal was to get an understanding of what type of precautions people who have severe allergies take when navigating the world. Because all 3 of our participants had severe food allergies, they naturally focused on the difficulty of eating out. The key struggle for all of them seemed to be lack of awareness and information to help people with severe allergies feel secure when eating a new dish or at a new place.           
### Interview Summaries
We performed explorative interviews with 3 participants. Two participants suffered themselves with severe nut allergies. The third participant is a sibling of an individual with extremely severe nut allergies. To protect the anonymity of the participants we do not provide their interview recordings.           -->
