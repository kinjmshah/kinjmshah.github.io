# Proposed Platform Redesign: Zoom for Office Hours

Zoom has become a major video conferencing platform for universities around the globe for facilitating remote instruction. While Zoom has begun to cater to the needs of remote instruction via additions such as breakout rooms, whiteboards, etc., it still falls severely short of student and instructor needs.

## User Research 

### Target User Demographic

While Zoom is widely used during this COVID-19 era, our primary user demographic are students and teaching staff. 

### Prototype Evaluation Users

*User 1*           
Age: 26     
Gender: Male       
Occupation: 5th year PhD student in Computer Science                   
Level of platform use: High, daily use 
User Role: Student, TA 

*User 2*      

### Diary Study: Event-Contingent Protocol

#### Rationale

In order to evaluate Zoom for Office Hour use, we needed to evaluate user experience during real office hours. Since office hours are relatively spontaneous events, and are individualized per class, it is not possible for us to observe users interacting with the interface without causing a disruption to the event. Therefore, the flexibility of the diary method enabled us to receive input from both teaching staff and student users.
