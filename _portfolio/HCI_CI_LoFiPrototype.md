## Proposed Platform Re-design: Google Scholar 

Google Scholar is a tool widely used to conduct research. As a leading search engine, Google and Google Scholar provide unparalleled search results and are invaluable resources. For those who know what they are looking for, the tool is very easy to use and allows for quick identification of target papers, patents, and books. However, for those pursuing research into a new domain, the user interface does not enable an organized and systematic search of published literature. Given the increase in electronic publishing of research, a redesign of the interface would increase productivity and lower frustration during literature search. 

## User Demographic

Google Scholar has a wide user demographic including students and professionals across industry and academia.

### Sample User
Age: 26           
Occupation: 5th year PhD student in Computer Science                   
Level of platform use: High, daily use 

## Contextual Inquiry

### Tasks 

*General Platform Objective: Search for papers on a topic of your choice*      

In addition to observing overall use of the platform to complete the general platform objective above, the user was asked to perform the following specific tasks:
- Select and save papers you identify as relevant 
- View the abstract of a paper
- Search for papers from a particular author or group of authors
- Identify peer-reviewed papers
- Select and save papers from the last year 

### Results

The contextual inquiry can be viewed in the video recording below. Key takeaways from observing each task and general platform interaction are listed here:

<ins>Select and save papers you identify as relevant</ins>        
- Started with general key word search
- Looked at title, published venue, citation count, and date published to evaluate papers 
- Clicked on title to view paper details 
- Copied paper link and opened in new tab to save paper for later deeper evaluation 

<ins>View the abstract of a paper</ins>
- Clicked on paper title 
- Clicked back on browser to return to search results 

<ins>Search for papers from a particular author or group</ins>                              
Path 1:          
- Searched for author name along with paper topic 
- Directed to author's google scholar page if one exists                                
Path 2:           
- Identified author of interest while skimming paper titles 
- If google scholar page exists, clicked on link for author 
- Stated, "I wish I could see papers this author has published on this particular topic, since they have so many publications"
- If google scholar page does not exist, searched for author along with topic area 

<ins>Identify Peer-Reviewed Papers</ins>
- Recognized venue names of well known venues 
- Usually scrolled past paper if venue name was not recognized and citation count was low 

<ins>Select and save relevant papers from the last year</ins>
- Clicked on "Since 2020" filter on left side of page 
- Skimmed list of paper titles, papers often in pre-print 
- Muttered under breath "I wish I could filter by citation count" 

<ins>Other notes from general platform use</ins>
- Usered wished for ability to search for high-impact papers/authors in a given area based on H-index 
- User often accidentally "saved" the same paper more than once 
- User looked through at maximum 2 pages of search results before changing search criteria
