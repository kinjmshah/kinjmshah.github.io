Google Scholar is a tool widely used to conduct research. As the leading search engine, Google and Google Scholar provide unparalleled search results and are invaluable resources. For those who know what they are looking for, the tool is very easy to use and allows for quick identification of target papers, patents, and books. However, for those pursuing research into a new domain, the user interface does not enable an organized and systematic search of published literature. Given the increase in electronic publishing of research, a redesign of the interface would increase productivity and lower frustration during literature search.
