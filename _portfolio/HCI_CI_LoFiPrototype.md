## Proposed Platform Re-design: Google Scholar 

Google Scholar is a tool widely used to conduct research. As a leading search engine, Google and Google Scholar provide unparalleled search results and are invaluable resources. For those who know what they are looking for, the tool is very easy to use and allows for quick identification of target papers, patents, and books. However, for those pursuing research into a new domain, the user interface does not enable an organized and systematic search of published literature. Given the increase in electronic publishing of research, a redesign of the interface would increase productivity and lower frustration during literature search. 

## User Demographic

Google Scholar has a wide user demographic including students and professionals across industry and academia.

### Sample User
Age: 26           
Occupation: 5th year PhD student in Computer Science                   
Level of platform use: High, daily use 

## Contextual Inquiry

### Tasks 

*General Platform Objective: Search for papers on a topic of your choice*      

In addition to observing overall use of the platform to complete the general platform objective above, the user was asked to perform the following specific tasks:
- Select and save papers you identify as relevant 
- View the abstract of a paper
- Search for papers from a particular author or group of authors
- Identify peer-reviewed papers
- Select and save papers from the last year 
- View high-impact papers and authors on this topic
