In the past decade, there has been an increased focus of using artificial intelligence to improve accessibility. This focus has lead to amazing assistive technologies such as voice assistance, voice to text, dynamic haptic text displays, and computer vision based guidance devices, just to name a few. 

From a design perspective, there are many factors to consider when designing such technologies. In particular, recent literature has highlihgted the importance of inclusive and representative design when developing accessible technology. In *Representing Users in Accessibility Research*, Sears and Hanson discuss the use of representative vs. non-representative users during user study design. They argue that using non-representative users and study design that replicates the conditions being evaluated does not capture the interactions those with disabilities have with technologies [1]. Both industry and academic researchers are underscoring the importance of ethical AI development for accessible populations such as in the *AI and Accessibility: A discussion of ethical considerations* article written by Dr. Morris, a researcher with Microsoft's Ability Research team. Dr. Morris highlights the current inclusivity, bias, and privacy limitations of current AI for accessibility research protocols. 

One example to highlight the importance of inclusive design is in the development of image captioning technologies. Existing 

Below is an interesting talk by Kriti Sharma about human bias in the development of AI technologies:
