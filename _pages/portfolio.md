## [Masters Thesis: Cognitive Load Aware User Interfaces for Mixed Reality Environments](/portfolio/mastersThesis)
*Coming Soon*

## [Early fall detection from video using 3D-CNNs](/portfolio/fallDetection)
Designed system to recognize and localize falls from video feed using 3D-CNNs. Implemented transfer learning approach using a model pretrained on the Kinetics-700 action recognition dataset and performed supervised fine-tuning on fall datasets.
