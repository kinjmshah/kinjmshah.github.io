## [Masters Thesis: Cognitive Load Aware User Interfaces for Mixed Reality Environments](/portfolio/mastersThesis)
***Presented at Women in Machine Learning Workshop, co-located with NeurIPS 2020***           
  
-- Coming Soon --            

## [Early fall detection from video using 3D-CNNs](/portfolio/fallDetection)
***Winner of Intuitive Surgical Best Project Award***             

According to the CDC, over 3 million adults are treated in emergency departments for fall related injuries each year. Accurate and real-time detection of falls is vital to timely intervention and minimization of long term effects. Our work uses a transfer learning approach from action recognition models pre-trained on the Kinetics-700 dataset to perform detection and localization of falls in video feed to both alert care providers and provide information that can help to assess fall severity.
