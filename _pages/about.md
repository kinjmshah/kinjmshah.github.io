I am a graduate student studying Robotics in the Laboratory of Computational Sensing and Robotics at Johns Hopkins University, passionate about the intersection of technology and medicine. My research interests focus on the integration of deep learning, augmented reality, and haptic interfaces to develop rehabilitation therapies and improve minimally-invasive treatments. 

My prior experiences involve research in point-of-care diagnostic device design and industry experience in technologies enabling accelerated R&D at medical device and biotechnology companies.

I am seeking product facing opportunities focused on medical device design and development. Please contact me if you have opportunities within this space at kshah31@jhu.edu.
