## Dance 

*Coming Soon*

## Food 

I love trying new restaurants and dishes, especially if it is vegetarian and contains mushrooms! Here I will post some of my favorite retauraunts and things to do by city. Currently I only have one for Boston, but a Philly one is in progress, and following grad school hopefully I'll have a new city to explore!
