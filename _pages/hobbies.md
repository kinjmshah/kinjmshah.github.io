## Dance 

I have been dancing since I could walk in a variety of Indian dance forms including Garba/Raas, Bharatnatyam, and Fusion. When I am not debugging code, I can often be found learning new routines from online tutorials or trying my hand at my own choreography.         

*More Details Coming Soon*

## Food 

I love trying new restaurants and dishes, especially if it is vegetarian and contains mushrooms! To help myself keep track of what I have tried, I will post some of my favorite retauraunts and things to do by city as well as some of my favorite recipes. Currently I only have a guide for Boston, but a Philly one is in progress, and following grad school hopefully I'll have a new city to explore!
