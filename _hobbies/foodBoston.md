*Anything bolded is an all time favorite, please note this will be a vegetarian friendly list in most cases since I am vegetarian! I put this list together for some friends who were moving to Boston, thought I would share here to help myself keep track of it and maybe help others who stumble upon it find some awesome food in Boston. Disclaimer, I am a pickly eater and have likely only tried 3-4 dishes at each place :D.*
